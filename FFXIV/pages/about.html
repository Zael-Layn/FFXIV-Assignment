            Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Square Enix. It is the fourteenth installment in the popular Final Fantasy series and was initially released on September 30, 2010, but it had a troubled launch and was subsequently re-released as "Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn" on August 27, 2013, to critical acclaim. Since then, it has received multiple expansions and updates, becoming one of the most successful and popular MMORPGs.<p></p>
<p></p>
            Here are some key aspects of Final Fantasy XIV:<p></p>
            <p></p>
            Gameplay: FFXIV features a traditional MMORPG gameplay style with character customization, questing, dungeons, raids, and player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player (PvP) content. Players can choose from a variety of races and classes, each with its unique abilities and playstyle.<p></p>
            <p></p>
            Story: The game has a rich and engaging storyline that is divided into different main scenarios and side quests. The plot is set in the fictional world of Eorzea, and it centers around various conflicts, including the struggles against the Garlean Empire, the threat of the Primals, and more.<p></p>
            <p></p>
            Expansions: Final Fantasy XIV has had several major expansions that have added new content, including additional playable races, classes, and regions. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the expansions were:<p></p>
            <p></p>
            A Realm Reborn (2.0)<p></p>
            Heavensward (3.0)<p></p>
            Stormblood (4.0)<p></p>
            Shadowbringers (5.0)<p></p>
            Endwalker (6.0)<p></p>
            <p></p>
            The game itself has over 20 different classes to choose from. You can create your own guild, purchase a house, play music with friends, visit clubs, and much much more!<p></p>

            If you're like me and want to be more of a Gatherer / Crafter and go out and fetch your own materials to upgrade and create your own armor digitally signed by you then there is that option for you as well!
